### Common Issues

---

**Issue:** "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'XXX'"

## üñ•Ô∏è GPU Support**Solution:** Run `python install.py` again or `pip install -r requirements_min.txt`



PolyVox Studio leverages GPU acceleration for significantly faster processing:**Issue:** Slow processing

**Solution:** Check GPU is being used. Install CUDA if you have NVIDIA GPU.

| Task | RTX 3080 | GTX 1080 | K80 | CPU Only |

|------|----------|----------|-----|----------|**Issue:** Audio quality is poor

| **Character Detection** | 30-60s | 1-2 min | 2-5 min | 5-10 min |**Solution:** Install FFmpeg for audio enhancement

| **Audio Generation** | 15-30s/min | 30-60s/min | 1-2 min/min | 5-10 min/min |

**Issue:** Chapter detection creates parts

### Supported GPUs**Solution:** Run `./clear_chapter_cache.sh` and re-detect chapters



‚úÖ **Standard Installation:****Issue:** Characters not detected properly

- RTX 40 series (4090, 4080, 4070)**Solution:** Process chapters individually for better results
