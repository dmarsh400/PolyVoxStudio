## Screenshot Guidelines

- **Format:** PNG (for best quality and transparency support)
- **Resolution:** HD (1280x720) minimum, Full HD (1920x1080) preferred
- **Content:** Show real data (use example books, not sensitive content)
- **Editing:** Optional: Add arrows or highlights to emphasize features

## Alternative: Use Placeholder Images

If screenshots aren't ready yet, the README will still work - the image links just won't display until files are added.
