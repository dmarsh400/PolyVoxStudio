# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## üìö General Questions

### What is PolyVox Studio?
PolyVox Studio is an AI-powered desktop application that converts novels into audiobooks with unique voices for each character. It uses BookNLP for character detection and Coqui TTS for voice synthesis.

### Is PolyVox Studio free?
Yes! PolyVox Studio is open-source and free to use under the MIT License.

### What file formats are supported?
Currently, PolyVox Studio supports plain text (.txt) files. EPUB support is coming soon.

### Do I need a GPU?
No, but it's highly recommended. GPU processing is 5-10x faster than CPU mode. See [GPU_COMPATIBILITY.md](../GPU_COMPATIBILITY.md) for details.

## üîß Installation & Setup

### Which installation should I use?
- **Standard installation:** For RTX 20xx+, GTX 16xx, or newer GPUs
- **Legacy installation:** For GTX 700-1080, K80, or older GPUs
- **Either works:** If you have no GPU or want CPU mode

See [GPU_COMPATIBILITY.md](../GPU_COMPATIBILITY.md) for a full compatibility chart.

### Installation failed. What should I do?
1. Check that you have Python 3.9+ installed: `python --version`
2. Ensure conda is in your PATH
3. Review error messages in the installation log
4. Check [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for common issues
5. Open a GitHub issue with the full error log

### Can I install both standard and legacy versions?
Yes! They use separate conda environments (`epub` and `vox_legacy`) and can coexist peacefully.

### How much disk space do I need?
- **Initial installation:** ~5-8 GB (models + dependencies)
- **Per book processed:** 100-500 MB (depends on book length)
- **Recommended:** 20 GB free space for comfortable usage

## üé≠ Character Detection

### Why are some characters not detected?
Character detection depends on:
- Character appearing in dialogue or narration
- Having a name (pronouns alone aren't enough)
- BookNLP's NLP model accuracy

**Tip:** You can manually add missing characters in the Characters tab.

### Characters are split (e.g., "John" and "John Smith")
This is normal! Use the **Merge Characters** feature:
1. Go to Characters tab
2. Select all variations (Ctrl+Click)
3. Click "Merge Characters"
4. Choose which name to keep

### Can I rename a character?
Yes! Use the **Rename Character** button in the Characters tab:
1. Select the character
2. Click "Rename Character"
3. Enter the new name
4. All dialogue lines will be updated

### Why does the Narrator have dialogue?
Sometimes attribution isn't perfect. You can:
- Reassign lines to the correct character
- Adjust the attribution confidence threshold in Settings
- Review and edit in the Characters tab

## üé§ Voice Cloning

### How long should my voice sample be?
**5-15 seconds** is ideal. Longer samples don't necessarily improve quality and may slow processing.

### What makes a good voice sample?
- Clear audio with no background noise
- Natural speech (not shouting or whispering)
- Multiple sentences with varied intonation
- 22050 Hz sample rate (converted automatically if different)

### Can I use my own voice?
Absolutely! Record a 10-second sample of yourself reading, upload it in the Clone Voices tab, and assign it to any character.

### How many voices can I clone?
You can clone **30 custom voices** (this is a UI limitation, not a technical one). Plus, there are 30+ built-in voices available.

### Voice quality is poor. What can I do?
- Use a better quality audio sample
- Ensure sample is 5-15 seconds
- Remove background noise
- Try a different built-in voice for comparison
- Check that GPU acceleration is enabled

## ‚ö° Performance & GPU

### How fast is audiobook generation?
Depends on your GPU:
- **RTX 3080:** ~15-30 seconds per minute of audio
- **GTX 1080:** ~30-60 seconds per minute of audio
- **K80:** ~1-2 minutes per minute of audio
- **CPU only:** ~5-10 minutes per minute of audio

### My GPU isn't being detected
1. Check that NVIDIA drivers are installed: `nvidia-smi`
2. Verify CUDA is available: In Python, run:
   ```python
   import torch
   print(torch.cuda.is_available())
   ```
3. For older GPUs, try the legacy installation
4. Check [GPU_COMPATIBILITY.md](../GPU_COMPATIBILITY.md)

### I'm getting "CUDA out of memory" errors
Reduce memory usage:
1. Go to Settings tab
2. Lower "Batch Size" (try 16 or 8)
3. Close other GPU-intensive applications
4. For very old GPUs, consider CPU mode

### Can I use AMD GPUs?
Currently, no. PolyVox Studio requires NVIDIA CUDA. AMD ROCm support may be added in the future.

## üìñ Book Processing

### How long does processing take?
For a typical 300-page novel:
- **Character Detection:** 10-30 minutes (GPU) or 1-2 hours (CPU)
- **Audio Generation:** 2-6 hours (GPU) or 10-20 hours (CPU)

### Can I process multiple books simultaneously?
Not currently within the same instance. You can run multiple instances of PolyVox Studio in separate terminals.

### The application froze. What happened?
Long processing tasks can appear frozen. Check:
1. The Debug tab for progress messages
2. CPU/GPU usage (should be high if processing)
3. The progress bar (may update slowly for large books)

**Tip:** First-time GPU use may have a 1-2 minute delay for JIT compilation.

### Can I pause and resume processing?
Not currently. Processing must complete or be cancelled. This feature is on the roadmap.

## üîä Audio Output

### What audio format is the output?
Currently WAV format. MP3, M4B, and OGG support are planned.

### Where are the audio files saved?
- **Default:** `output_audio/` directory
- **Per-character files:** `output_audio/[character_name]/`
- **Full audiobook:** Combined file in `output_audio/` (if enabled)

### Can I adjust audio quality?
Yes, in the Settings tab:
- Sample rate (default: 22050 Hz)
- Bit depth
- Encoding quality

### Audio has strange pauses or pacing
This can happen with complex punctuation. Try:
- Reviewing the text in Characters tab
- Manually adjusting dialogue breaks
- Adjusting TTS speed settings (coming soon)

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" errors
The conda environment may not be activated:
```bash
conda activate epub          # Standard installation
conda activate vox_legacy    # Legacy installation
```

### Application won't start
1. Check Python version: `python --version` (should be 3.9+)
2. Verify environment is activated
3. Check for error messages in terminal
4. Try reinstalling: `./install.sh` or `install.bat`

### BookNLP model download failed
- Check your internet connection
- Try manually downloading from [BookNLP releases](https://github.com/booknlp/booknlp/releases)
- Place in `models/` directory

### Changes aren't saving
- Check file permissions in the project directory
- Ensure you're not running multiple instances
- Look for error messages in the Debug tab
